  7z x -0<>directory name> <archive name>
  
Brightness:
  Set using sxhkd to super + F5 to decrease by 20%, super + F6 to increase by 20%
  This uses xbacklight

Add a desktop to bspwm if it only has one:
  bspc monitor -a Desktop2
  Then, super+{1,9} to switch desktops
  Use super+shift+{1,9} to move the focussed node to the selected desktop
  Be careful because super+shift+4 is my way of pressing alt+f4 in a vm
